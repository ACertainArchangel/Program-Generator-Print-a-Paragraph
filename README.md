### Objective
Your challenge is to write a program that, given a paragraph from a book, will output *another* program that prints out that paragraph. (See my example program in an answer)

### Scoring
The link below is to a .txt file on GitHub containing 100 paragraphs to use your code on. Your score will be the product of the size of your main program in bytes and the mean size of the output programs produced by your main program for the 100 paragraphs.

### Information/Hints
 * Make it easy for yourself to unit test and please include your testing code. Feel free to modify my python testing script from the sample answer.
 * No scraping content from GitHub!
